|-------|------|----------|
| ![](img/david.jpg) | 16/01/24 | Met with team; |
| | 23/01/24 | Identification of errors from previous labâ€™s code and correction of wire placement from Arduino to Motor Driver Board to get motors operating correctly with PWM signals and button input.  Wiring of Encoder to Arduino and testing of code to check the serial monitor values increment with motor rotations. Carried out the Risk Assesment. |
