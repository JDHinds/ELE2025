| Image | Week | Progress |
|-------|------|----------|
| ![](img/david.jpg) | 16/01/24 | Met with team; |
| | 23/01/24 | Identification of errors from previous labâ€™s code and correction of wire placement from Arduino to Motor Driver Board to get motors operating correctly with PWM signals and button input.  Wiring of Encoder to Arduino and testing of code to check the serial monitor values increment with motor rotations. Carried out the Risk Assesment.|
| | 30/01/24 | Wiring of Encoder on second motor to Arduino and testing of code to check the serial monitor values increment with motor rotations for both motors.  Connection of battery instead of power supply to allow for wireless movement.  Research of Infrared Line Tracking Sensor to determine the wiring and potential code to be used.|
| | 06/02/24 | Wiring and coding of Infrared Line Tracking Sensor to detect a difference between white and black on a page.  Glued wheels and fitted stabilising wheel from old chassis onto new chassis.|
| | 20/02/24 | Building of new chassis and fitting of components.  IR Sensors working, and trial code uploaded to test on Track.  Changed sensors to back and reversed motor direction in code to allow for more sharp cornering.|

| ![](img/jude.jpg) | 16/01/24 | Met with team; chosen as team leader; appointed as Programming Lead, and wrote the code for the tasks in the first lab. Was unable to verify code due to technical issues. |
| | 23/01/24 | Fixed code from last week's lab; wrote RotationUsingEncoder code. Carried out the Risk Assesment. |

| ![](img/oran.jpg) | 16/01/24 | Met with team; |
| | 30/01/24 | Began the design of the robot. Decided on a two tier, two wheel system with a stabliser wheel at the back. Have a basic schematic drawn out on paper, need to move this onto Fusion 360. | 
| | 5/02/24  | Completed a basic design mock-up on fusion 360. 2 basic panels, 150mm, 100mm, 5mm. Each panel has 4 holes located in corners 10mm in diameter. the bottom panel additional has a hole at the back, (30mm in diameter) which is for the stablising wheel. the pilers are 60mm tall and 10mm in diameter. |

| | 23/01/24 | Worked on the proportional control algorithm code using Arduino. |
| | 30/01/24 | Made a start on the code that will be used to implement the Infrared Sensors to help with the line tracking. |
